Final Project: Wine quality prediction using Machine Learnings

  The objective of this research is to demonstrate and explain important aspects of using machine learning methods in predictive analytics for the wine predicting process. First, machine learning models can be used to decide wine quality. Second, machine learning models can achieve a very high accuracy rate in predicting wine quality, over 80%. 

  For this study, two large data sets from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2009) were used to train and test the models. These datasets are red wine and white wine, containing 1599 and 4898 instances respectively. 
  
  Both datasets have 11 features of physicochemical data, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol, used to determine the wine quality as the dependent variable.

  This study will employ 5 supervised machine learning algorithms, including decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVC), logistic regression model, and Na√Øve Bayes.
